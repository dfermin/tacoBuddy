// This is the generic class. The specific VCF Info features are inherited from this class
public class FeatureClass {

    // Theoretically, variables common to all the the VCF Info features would go here.
    // But as fo 2016.Jan.09 all of our Features are so different that we have nothing in common to put here.
    // Honestly this class was created so I could dynamically store the various feature objects.
